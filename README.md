## üåü Highlights

- Simple tool for symmetric cryptography
- Features Encryption and Decryption
- Derives cryptography key from passwords
- Anonymous naming of encrypted files


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This is a simple tool made for encrypting and decrypting files run completely from the CLI. It reads the bytes in a file and encrypts/decrypts it using a key derived from a password. There is an option for anonymous naming of encrypted files to prevent sharing unwanted information. The default mode is encryption if the -m flag is not specified.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python nCrypt.py example.txt -a -p hello123
```
This command will encrypt the 'example.txt' file with a key derived from the password 'hello123', and give it an anonymous name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scoutmeister/nCrypt.git
```
